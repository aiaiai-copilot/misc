# Task 12 - E2E Testing Session Summary (2025-10-09)

## What Was Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. E2E Solution Implementation (Option 1 - Dev Server)
- **Modified**: `playwright.config.ts`
  - Changed `baseURL` from `http://localhost:4173` to `http://localhost:5173`
  - Changed webServer command from `yarn preview` to `yarn dev`
  - Added inline documentation explaining the dev server choice
- **Result**: Keyboard events now work correctly in E2E tests
- **Files**: `playwright.config.ts:31,89`

### 2. E2E Page Object Simplification
- **Modified**: `e2e/support/page-objects/MiscPage.ts`
  - Simplified `createRecord()` method following Playwright documentation patterns
  - Removed complex verification and timing logic
  - Used standard Playwright pattern: `clear()` ‚Üí `fill()` ‚Üí `press('Enter')`
- **Result**: More reliable test execution
- **Files**: `e2e/support/page-objects/MiscPage.ts:70-83`

### 3. Documentation Updates
- **Updated**: `docs/techdebt.md`
  - Added "Current Status Summary" section at top
  - Marked Playwright compatibility issue as RESOLVED
  - Updated test results: 15 passing, 12 failing
  - Documented that failures are due to database cleanup, NOT Playwright
- **Updated**: `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` (via `tm update-subtask`)
  - Added implementation notes to task 12.6
  - Documented 56% pass rate achievement

## Current Test Results üìä

### Pass Rate: 56% (15/27 tests)
**Passing Tests**:
- ‚úÖ First Use Experience (3/3)
- ‚úÖ Basic record management (partial)
- ‚úÖ Some keyboard navigation scenarios
- ‚úÖ Toolbar and menu functionality

### Fail Rate: 44% (12/27 tests)
**Failing Tests**:
- ‚ùå Creating multiple records
- ‚ùå Record editing
- ‚ùå Real-time search
- ‚ùå Multi-tag search
- ‚ùå Tag cloud display
- ‚ùå List display
- ‚ùå Tag normalization
- ‚ùå Import/Export functionality
- ‚ùå Keyboard navigation with multiple records

**Common Error Pattern**: All failures show identical database constraint violation:
```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "records_normalized_tags_key"
Detail: Key (normalized_tags)=({}) already exists.
```

## What Needs to Be Done Next üî¥

### HIGH PRIORITY: Database Cleanup Issue

**Problem**: Empty records with `normalized_tags=({})` are being created and not cleaned up between tests.

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Why are empty records being created?
   - Is the frontend sending empty content in some scenarios?
   - Are tests accidentally submitting before filling input?
   - Is there a race condition in form submission?

2. Why is `clearAllRecords()` not working?
   - Does it properly delete ALL records including empty ones?
   - Is there a timing issue with the cleanup?
   - Are records being created after cleanup but before tests?

**Files to Investigate**:
- `e2e/support/api-helpers.ts` - `clearAllRecords()` implementation
- `e2e/support/global-setup.ts` - Pre-test cleanup
- `e2e/support/global-teardown.ts` - Post-test cleanup
- `packages/backend/src/middleware/validation.ts` - Backend validation (should reject empty content)

**Recommendations**:
1. Add logging to `clearAllRecords()` to see what's being deleted
2. Add logging to test setup to see when records are created
3. Consider using unique test data (timestamps/UUIDs) to avoid conflicts
4. Verify backend validation is rejecting empty content correctly
5. Check if tests are running in proper isolation

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

## Files Modified in This Session

1. **playwright.config.ts** - Changed to dev server (lines 31, 89)
2. **e2e/support/page-objects/MiscPage.ts** - Simplified createRecord method (lines 70-83)
3. **docs/techdebt.md** - Added status summary and updated test results
4. **.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json** - Updated task 12.6 with implementation notes

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Full E2E test suite
yarn workspace @misc-poc/presentation-web test:e2e --project=chromium

# Expected result: 15 passed, 12 failed
```

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Playwright Documentation is Critical**: Following official patterns from Context7 MCP was more effective than custom solutions
2. **Dev Server vs Production**: React's synthetic event handling differs significantly between builds
3. **Separate Issues**: The Playwright compatibility issue (SOLVED) is completely separate from the database cleanup issue (UNSOLVED)
4. **Test Results Interpretation**: 56% pass rate is progress from 0%, but regression to 41% showed my attempted fixes made things worse

## Next Session Checklist

- [ ] Read this summary document
- [ ] Read `docs/techdebt.md` "Current Status Summary" section
- [ ] Focus on database cleanup issue, NOT Playwright compatibility
- [ ] Run test suite to verify starting state: `yarn workspace @misc-poc/presentation-web test:e2e --project=chromium`
- [ ] Expected: 15 passed, 12 failed
